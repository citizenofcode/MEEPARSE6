# mee6-parse
Parses MEE6 (the Discord Bot)'s level-up messages to give roles based on levels.
## Selfhosting
This bot is pretty friendly for selfhosting. I recommend [Glitch](glitch.me) for the simplest experience.
1. Create Discord application, invite bot to server.
2. Fill out config.json with the necessary values.
3. Install required packages.
4. Run bot.
